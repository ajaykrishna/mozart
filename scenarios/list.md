| 21 | User said that the music is not always played at 7:30 am. The system requires the child to wake up and move to make the motion sensor activate the stereo. I argued that the baby was frequently oversleeping, and the rule the user made was useless to prevent it. So, he made rules for two situations. When the baby woke up before 8:30, the stereo was played. When the baby did not, the stereo turned on automatically to wake the baby up |
